# Task 3 – Secure File Sharing with Encryption

🎯 Objective:
To simulate secure file sharing by encrypting a file using symmetric encryption (GPG), verifying its integrity, and decrypting it securely.

🛠️ Tools Used:
- gpg (GNU Privacy Guard)
- sha256sum
- nano
- gnome-screenshot
- Kali Linux (non-root user)

📦 Steps:
1. Created a file `secret_plan.txt` with sensitive content
2. Encrypted using `gpg -c` and passphrase: future@123
3. Decrypted using `gpg` and same passphrase
4. Verified file integrity with `sha256sum` before and after decryption
5. Compared both hash files with `diff`
6. Took screenshot of the verification process

✅ Outcome:
The file was securely encrypted, transmitted, decrypted, and verified. Hashes matched, confirming zero tampering. This completes secure file sharing simulation.
